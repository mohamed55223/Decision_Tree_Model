# Decision_Tree_Model

## Decision Tree Classifier

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier. The Decision Tree algorithm is a popular supervised learning method used for classification tasks. It builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences based on a given dataset.

## Features
- Handles both categorical and numerical features
- Supports binary and multi-class classification
- Provides options for handling missing values and pruning the tree
- Includes visualization capabilities to understand the decision-making process

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/your_username](https://github.com/mohamed55223/Decision_Tree_Model.git`


## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, NumPy array).
2. Modify the `main.py` file to load your dataset and configure the parameters
4. The decision tree will be trained on the provided data and evaluated using appropriate metrics.
5. Additional options and customization can be explored in the codebase.

## Examples
To get started quickly, we have included some example datasets under the `data` directory. You can use these datasets to experiment with the decision tree classifier.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community to enhance this decision tree classifier. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing coding style and provide appropriate tests for your changes.
